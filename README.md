  ## Description 

  This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Unit tests are included for each part of the code.
  
  When this application is run in the command line, it accepts user input about team members. When prompted in the command line, the user will enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, then the user will be presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building the team. 
  If the engineer option is selected, the user is prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and then taken back to the menu.
  If the intern option is selected, the user is prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and then taken back to the menu.
  When the user selects the option to finish building the team, the program ends, and the user is directed to the compiled HTML file in the /dist folder. The HTML file that is generated displays a nicely formatted team roster based the on user input. 
  After opening the page in the browser, users can click on an email address to open their default email program and populate the TO field of the email with the address. Users can click on the GitHub username to see that GitHub profile open in a new tab.
